            <h3>Automated Stand Delineation</h3>
            <p>
                Part of our process in making recommendations to landowners involved delineating stand boundaries for their forested land. Typically, this is a fully manual process done by a forestor. I wrote an image processing pipeline that delineated stands using NAIP imagery, canopy height derived from lidar and various raster sources to approximate forest type/species and age of the trees. This rolled out initially as a semi-automated tool for our foresters to use, but eventually I built a fully automated pipeline that could delineate stands in under 10 seconds.

            <p>
                Part of our product strategy at NCX was giving landowners personalized estimates of various natural capital assets on their land. This includes things like timber value, carbon storage potential and forest health. We explored several approaches to creating this data, from an FIA plot state transition model to eventually using the US Forest Service's own Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). I created a distributed pipeline using Dask on Coiled to run FVS across tens of thousands of FIA plots in under an hour. The end product is an interactive widget that allows landowners to experiment with different management strategies and see how this affects their natural capital scores.

            <h3>Land Explorer App</h3>
            <p>
                NCX offers a personalized land report called "Natural Capital Advisor" or NCA. The goal of NCA is to provide personalized insights that align a landowner's goals with a feasible managment plan and offer a variety of potential programs to assist funding the implementation of this plan. This is a largely manual process, wherein a trained expert must analyze the property in order to make a recommendation. 

                An earlier product we tested at NCX was a land explorer app, known internally as the "Atlas" App. This application aggregates a variety of sources related to natural resources and earth observation data and makes it available via an interactive front end. This did not resonate with users in initial testing, but I eventually repurposed the Atlas App to assist us internally with assessing a landowner's property for NCA reports.

                The Atlas App includes everything from Timber volume and price estimates, to in depth soil analysis, localized flora and fauna prevalence.

I built a simple pipeline using PDAL to process the Lidar, including colorizing using NAIP or Hexagon aerial imagery. I also experimented with visualizing the point clouds in Deck.gl. Pictured here is a collage of some of the maps I generated, including Tower Grove Park in St. Louis.

                In valuing natural capital, timber serves as an important baseline for comparison. I built a timber pricing model, scraping numerous data sources for timber prices and combining this with volume estimates to generate accurate estimates of timber value. We eventually sourced a number of proprietary data sources to provide timely information about changes in timber value with the market as well.

            <p>
                With the launch of NCX 2.0, focusing on matching landowners with available opportunities for natural capital developments, we needed to build an entirely new pipeline to stream assessment results to the end-user platform. We built a FastAPI application with a Celery backend, fully integrated with all of the microservices from the <a class="hlight" href="https://eoapi.dev/">eoAPI stack</a> developed by DevSeed.
                This brought tons of visualization features to the platform as well as intelligent cataloging and management of raster data. I fully migrated and deprecated our Databricks implementation, savings us thousands of dollars per month in compute costs.

            <p>
                As we had been migrating an increasing amount of our data to Spark on Databricks, we needed a way to efficiently process and analyze raster data at scale. I built a large pipeline in Spark that allowed us to ingest, process and analyze raster data across the continental United States. We explored a number of raster interpolation and storage methods, ultimately implementing our own solutions before the maturity of raster solutions in <a class="hlight" href="https://github.com/apache/sedona">Apache Sedona</a> or <a class="hlight" href="https://github.com/databrickslabs/mosaic">Databrick Mosaic</a>.

            <p>
                Working with continental scale parcel data was a neccessity for some of the types of analyses we wanted to perform. Crucially, we needed to know the full land holdings of an individual entity across the United States.

                We had around 150 million individual property records and we wanted to be able for any individual owner to query every property under their ownership.

                To achieve this, I used a variety of natural language processing techniques and a network simplification method to build a CONUS-wide dataset of all properties owned by a single entity.

            <p>
                One of the pain points of working on a mid-sized engineering team was dependency management, rigourous testing and an automated deploy schedule.

                More than a dozen data scientists and engineers shared a single monolithic Docker image. Dependency requirements often conflicted, were often out of date and sometimes upgrades would cause silent failures.

                Several other engineers and I built a robust pipeline of Github Actions to improve dependency testing of new feature branches and handle routine upgrades automatically. Of particular impact was just 6 lines of code that allowed us to reproduce CI failures within Github Actions, allowing us to debug issues without needing to run the code locally.

I implemented much of the core crediting logic, including a full process to make intermediate data available for a third-party audit.

                When I arrived at NCX, the standard procedure for recording data was files in cloud storage. This made it difficult for us to run large analytical workloads across datasets and further caused issues due to a lack of schema enforcement.

                One of my first large infrastructure projects at NCX was migrating us to a fixed schema in a single source of data. We implemented a short term solution with BigQuery but I later migrated the majority of our datasets into Spark on Databricks.

                My solution involved a thorough schema normalization process and the use of file streaming to automatically catalog new data generated while still maintaining our legacy processes.

                One of our concerns as we scaled our carbon crediting pipeline at NCX was the integrity of the underlying models we used to predict and generate carbon credits. Specifically, we used a serious of various models in combination to predict harvest risk, prioritize ground sampling, detect loss events and project carbon yields.

                Given the initiative to benchmark each of these models for continuous improvement across future cycles, I was tasked with creating an MLOps system that could work across models in different environments.

                For this, I used MLFlow hosted on Databricks. I worked with the data scientist responsible for each model and created a set of metrics to be cataloged for each model training. I implemented the logic to generate and upload these metrics to our MLFlow instance and created an ETL pipeline to combine these into a Metabase dashboard for the team to review and guide future data investments.

                The feasability of a timber harvest is largely constrained by the distances and availability of wood processing facilities for the harvested timbers.

                I constructed an isochrone model that considered the characteristics of log-hauling vehicles, road limitations and mill locations by wood product type and capacity. This was another key input to our harvest risk model.

                Timber price estimates were an integral part of our harvest risk model for determining the economic pressure to harvest specific tree stands. 

                I built a robust set of multi-modal scraping utilities to extract timber stumpage prices from a varierty of sources, including XML parsing, headless browser automation and PDF/Image OCR. Then, I created a standardized schema, complex unit transformations (there are as many as 87 standard measures for timber volumes!) and a pipeline for updating these data quarterly.

                Data is powerful, but only in the hands of the right people.

Recognizing this, we set out to develop the data commons. Just as Swagger and ReDoc have made the process of documenting REST APIs trivial, the Data Commons aims to deliver data in an easily consumable format (CSV) and also offer quick visualization of queried data.

                One challenge we encountered at the Regional Data Alliance was developing in the open with a low barrier to entry. We had a number of volunteers and external contributors who would often work short or unpredictable periods. 
                At the Regional Data Alliance we developed in the open, including infrastructure, and wanted a repeatable technology pattern to work across projects and repositories. I presented our technical stack at a local technical meetup, and used this an as opportunity to recruit new contributors.

            <p>
                Perhaps the most important metric during the COVID-19 pandemic was frequency of hospitalization and total hospital utitlization. Measuring confirmed cases through tests alone is extremely prone to under-ascertainment. Hospitalizations, however, are nearly unavoidable and offer direct insight into the true severity of COVID-19 transmission. Hospital utilization also signals the most risk of mortality, both in the progression of COVID-19 infections and the capacity for healthcare systems to address other critical forms of medical treatment.

            </p>
            <p>
                The model was updated weekly with inputs from all health systems across the state, aggregated by our partners at the Missouri Hospital Association, and used both to project future hospitalizations and simulate the effect of various public health interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Model results were shared prominently with stakeholders across the state, including the Governor's office, the Missouri Hospital Association, the St. Louis Covid Task Force, local health agencies and the largest healthcare providers in the state, among others.

                A small, untapped research agenda of mine is understanding how the economics of hospital pricing influence the populations most served. The untested hypothesis is that higher prices or poor network benefits in more geographically proximal instituions result in upward pressure on lower priced medical facilities, which becomes a particular burden in seasonal periods of high utilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The difficulty in pursuing this research inquiry is the lack of transparency in hospital service price reporting, even depsite <a class="hlight" href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/key-initiatives/hospital-price-transparency">government regulation</a> to do so.

                Crime is something that has long been a public issue for the City of St. Louis and has fueled decades of divisive discourse. Understanding how we got here and what to do about it was the research inquiry that lead to the start of my career in public health.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined the Gun Violence Prevention Center at Washington University's Institute for Public health and used my skillset across a variety of research into crime, econometrics and violence prevention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the earliest products to come out of this work was a public dashboard that allowed anyone to observe any cross-section of crime they were interested in, including custom maps, time series trends and environmental covariates of crime.    
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a major undertaking, building a process to scrape transform and normalize a variety of data and building a full stack application to interact with these data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the project became unmaintained when SLMPD stopped publicly releasing data at the end of 2020.

            <h3>Testing sensitivity to MAUP with Polyominoes</h3>
            <p>
                In unfinished work, I begin to develop a sensitivity analysis to the Modifiable Areal Units Problem (MAUP) using <a class="hlight" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino">Polyominoes</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This unconvential approach to producing a randomized sampling kernel using Polyominoes offered a robust stochastic method both for the measurement of MAUP sensitivity as well as the re-allocation of aggregate spatial data for further analysis. It's main shortcoming, however, was the massive ammounts of compute required to scale the kernel size over larger or higher resolution geographic data.

            <h3>Patterns of Civic Engagement</h3>
            <p>
                Part of my research as an undegraduate involved exploring new sources of data for analyzing and understanding cities. This included 311 data, or requests for non-emergency city services. In the City of St. Louis, this is known as the Citizen's Service Bureau, or CSB.
            </p>
            <p>
                One inquiry that I had about these data was how representative they are of localized civic engagement. The hypothesis was that areas of low voter participation would also have a low utilization rate of the CSB.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results were remarkably well aligned with my hypothesis, showing a high correlation of voter participation with CSB utilization, and the effect size was greater in local elections compared to the presidential election.

            <h3>Building an Open Source Geocoder</h3>
            <p>
                Geocoding, the act of converting an address string into a numeric location, was a central part of my education in GIS and a recurrent neccessity in my research. After having dealt with a number of nuanced datasets that required specific preprocessing to achieve desriable geocodes, Chris Prener and I decided to build our own.
            </p>
            <p>
                We built our own geocoder in R and compared it with a number of commercial geocoding options available at the time, including several free sources, and published our findings in <a class="hlight" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12741">Trasactions in GIS.</a>

                The Modifiable Areal Units Problem (MAUP) was a key component of my studies and research in GIS. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With the areal R package, Chris Prener and I attempt to implement a variety of methods for areal weighted interpolation using the spatial features (SF) framework in place of the older SP framework for spatial data in R.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dasymetric, Pycnophylactic, Regression and Hybrid methods were implemented for both spatially intensive and extensive data types.

            <h3>Creating a Definition of Vacancy</h3>
            <p>
                St. Louis, Missouri has experienced one of the most salient urban declines in the country, resulting in a rise of property vacancy. It was long suspected this was pivotal in a variety of worsened outcomes, but a clear definition of vacancy and the corresponding number and location of vacant properties was unknown. I played a foundational role in building the defintion, data infrastructure and dissemination of the number and locations of vacant properties in St. Louis.

            <p>
                I became heavily involved in the <a class="hlight" href="https://www.stlvacancy.com/">St. Louis Vacancy Collaborative</a> including the creation and implementation of the <a class="hlight" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5eSS_hIZTUH0kCArw58N-TBUvT8VB57KeF6LvGBX34/edit">Vacant Property Methodology</a>.

                In my undergraduate honor's thesis, I explore the historic demographic shift of the City of St. Louis through a lens of mortgage lending incentives and practices. I analyze Home Mortgage Discloure Act (HMDA) data over time in addition to various demographic and econometric sources and elucidate a clear effect of divestment on future demographic and economic decline.

            <p>
                While doing a variety of research with large datasets, such as county voter files or police dispatch records, geocoding became a complicated and expensive process. Often, the potential cost of geocoding these records made certain inquiries infeasible from the start. At some point, I discovered the US Census Bureau's public geocoding service. Soon after, I developed an R package to automatically geocode dataframes using this API.

            <h3>Scooter Distribution</h3>
            <p>
                As part of the permitting process to allow dockless vehicle (bicycle & scooter) companies to operate in the City of St. Louis, companies are required to <a class="hlight" href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/street/traffic/bicycling/st-louis-dockless-bike-share-faq.cfm#5">park 16% of their fleet in designated equity zones.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                After observing a heavy concentration of vehicles in the more-affluent central cooridor of the City, I was determined to validate whether these equity targets were in-fact being met.
            </p>
            <p>
                After being declined access to the data from a number of Rideshare companies, I <a class="hlight" href="https://github.com/ubahnverleih/WoBike">reverse-engineered their APIs</a> and logged vehicle locations for several weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                After collecting several weeks of data, I was confident that the operating companies were very loosely adhering to this stipulation in the permit. Neither local news outlets nor the City Traffic Division were interested in evaluating my data.

            <h3>Barriers to Emergency Response</h3>
            <p>
                In unpublished work titled "Detours" I investigate the impact of street closures, meant to deter crime, on potential emergency response times.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created two methodical road network models representing the City of St. Louis with and without these barriers, including speed limits and turn penalties. I then ran simulated routes originating from various emergency service locations and reaching every building footprint in the City.
            </p> 
            <p>
                After completing my undergraduate studies I lost access to the license neccessary to use the road network data and I stopped pursuing this line of research.
