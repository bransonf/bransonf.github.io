            <p>
                Part of our product strategy at NCX was giving landowners reliable, personalized estimates of various natural capital assets on their land. This includes things like timber harvest, enrollment in harvest-deferral programs for generating carbon credits.

                For this, I developed a series of models grounded in FIA plot sampling data.

                NCX offers a personalized land report called "Natural Capital Advisor" or NCA.

                One of the products we tested at NCX was a land explorer app. This application aggregated a variety of sources related to natural resources and earth observation data and made it available via an interactive front end.

                With the launch of NCX 2.0, focusing on matching landowners with available opportunities for natural capital developments, we needed to build an entirely new pipeline to stream assessment results to the end-user platform. 

                Brought tons of visualization features to the platform. Intelligent cataloging and management of raster data.

            <p>
                Working with continental scale parcel data was a neccessity for some of the types of analyses we wanted to perform. Crucially, we needed to know the full land holdings of an individual entity across the United States.

                We had around 150 million individual property records and we wanted to be able for any individual owner to query every property under their ownership.

                To achieve this, I used a variety of natural language processing techniques and a network simplification method to build a CONUS-wide dataset of all properties owned by a single entity.

            <p>
                One of the pain points of working on a mid-sized engineering team was dependency management, rigourous testing and an automated deploy schedule.

                More than a dozen data scientists and engineers shared a single monolithic Docker image. Dependency requirements often conflicted, were often out of date and sometimes upgrades would cause silent failures.

                The other data engineers and I built a robust pipeline of Github Actions to improve dependency testing of new feature branches and handle routine upgrades automatically.

                Essential to the integrity of our Carbon crediting program at NCX was the the methodology we used to generate the actual carbon credits we offered for sale. I implemented much of the core crediting logic, including a full process to make intermediate data available for a third-party audit.

            <h3>Data Warehouse Migration</h3>
            <p>
                When I arrived at NCX, the standard procedure for recording data was files in cloud storage. This made it difficult for us to run large analytical workloads across datasets and further caused issues for lack of schema enforcement.

                One of my first large infrastructure projects at NCX was migrating us to a fixed schema in a single source of data. We implemented a short term solution with BigQuery but I later migrated the majority of our datasets into Spark on Databricks.

                My solution involved a thorough schema normalization process and the use of file streaming to automatically catalog new data generated while still maintaining our legacy processes.

            <h3>Benchmarking Platform</h3>
            <p>
                One of our concerns as we scaled our carbon crediting pipeline at NCX was the integrity of the underlying models we used to predict and generate carbon credits. Specifically, we used a serious of various models in combination to predict harvest risk, prioritize ground sampling, detect loss events and project carbon yields.

                Given the initiative to benchmark each of these models for continuous improvement across future cycles, I was tasked with creating an MLOps system that could work across models in different environments.

                For this, I used MLFlow hosted on Databricks. I worked with the data scientist responsible for each model and created a set of metrics to be cataloged for each model training. I implemented the logic to generate and upload these metrics to our MLFlow instance and created an ETL pipeline to combine these into a Metabase dashboard for the team to review and guide future data investments.

            <h3>Mill Pressure Model</h3>
            <p>
                The feasability of a timber harvest is largely constrained by the distances and availability of wood processing facilities for the harvested timbers.

                I constructed an isochrone model that considered the characteristics of log-hauling vehicles, road limitations and mill locations by wood product type and capacity.

            <h3>Timber Price Scrapers</h3>
            <p>
                Timber price estimates were an integral part of our harvest risk model for determining the economic pressure to harvest specific tree stands. 

                I built a robust set of multi-modal scraping utilities to extract timber stumpage prices from a varierty of sources, including XML parsing, headless browser automation and PDF/Image OCR. Then, I created a standardized schema, complex unit transformations and a pipeline for updating these data quarterly.

                Data is powerful, but only in the hands of the right people. APIs are a powerful way for programmers to access data in an organized way, but for less technically proficient consumers, a REST API may be a barrier to data access. Recognizing this, we set out to develop the data commons. Just as Swagger and ReDoc have made the process of documenting REST APIs trivial, the Data Commons aims to deliver data in an easily consumable format (CSV) and also offer quick visualization of queried data.

            <p>
                As part of my efforts in developing the solution for contact tracing COVID-19 cases in St. Louis, Missouri, I built a custom HL7 parser in R to read the esoteric HL7 messaging format used by medical laboratories. Using this, we identified tens of thousands of positive test results days before the statewide reporting results.

            <p>
                Geocoding, the act of converting an address string into a numeric location, was a central part of my education in GIS and a recurrent theme in my research. After having dealt with a number of nuanced datasets that required specific preprocessing to achieve desriable geocodes, my advisor Chris Prener and I decided to build our own.

                We compared a number of commercial geocoding options available at the time,

                The Modifiable Areal Units Problem (MAUP) was a key component of my studies and research in GIS. 

                With the areal R package, Chris Prener and I attempt to implement a variety of methods for areal weighted interpolation.

                Dasymetric, Pycnophylactic, Regressive and Hybrid methods were implemented for both spatially intensive and extensive data types.

            <h3>Creating a Definition of Vacancy</h3>
            <p>
                St. Louis, Missouri has experienced one of the most salient urban declines in the country, resulting in a rise of property vacancy. It was long suspected this was pivotal in a variety of worsened outcomes, but a clear definition of vacancy and the corresponding number and location of vacant properties was unknown. I played a foundational role in building the defintion, data infrastructure and dissemination of the number of vacant properties in St. Louis.

                I became heavily involved in the St. Louis Vacancy Collaborative

            <h3>Scooter Distribution</h3>
            <p>
                As part of the permitting process to allow dockless vehicle (bicycle & scooter) companies to operate in the City of St. Louis, companies are required to <a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/street/traffic/bicycling/st-louis-dockless-bike-share-faq.cfm#5">park 16% of their fleet in designated equity zones.</a>
                <br>
                After observing a heavy concentration of vehicles in the more-affluent central cooridor of the City, I was determined to validate whether these equity targets were in-fact being met.
                <br>
                After being declined access to the data from a number of Rideshare companies, I <a href="https://github.com/ubahnverleih/WoBike">reverse-engineered their APIs</a> and logged vehicle locations for several weeks.
                <br>
                After collecting several weeks of data, I was confident that the operating companies were not adhering to this stipulation in the permit.
