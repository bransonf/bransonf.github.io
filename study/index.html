            <p>
                <li>Plot</li>
                The books describes Igbo culture in the first section. And in the next two sections it talks about colonialism and the effect of christian missionaries.
                <li>Part 1</li>
                Okonkwo is a hard working and strong man. He never wants to show fear or look weak. He is trying to accumulate wealth all on his own for his family. His father died a shameful death has many unpiad debts that make them look bad. he beats his wives and children and is unkind to others. However, he becomes a leader in the village. Due to a prophecy, he kills the boy he was supposed to be protecting. Things get even worse, as his daughter gets sick and a gun accident kills another mans son. His family is sent into exhile.
                <li>Part 2</li>
                Okonkwo learns that white men are living in his old village and trying to convert them to christianity. Increasingly people convert and must face becoming the society of white people.
                <li>Part 3</li>
                Okonkwo comes back to his village to find that it has changed a lot. After a convert does somthing heinous, they burn a christain church. The white people take Okonkwo and other leaders prisoner and demands payment. They are humiliated by their captors, who shave their heads and whipping them. Okonkwo decides to go to war with the white people and beheads one of them. Realzing that his people are going to back him up, he realizes how much his village has changed. To avoid having to go to court, he hangs himself, which is severely dishonorable.

                The importance is that white missionaries we able to totally change the Igbo culture. Without strong leaders (like kings) it was vulnerable to the change of culture. Westerners were able to bring their culture to africa.

        <h2>Colonial Economy</h2>
            <p>provided a measure of opportunity for enterprising women, particularly in small-scale trade and marketing. In some parts of West Africa, women came to dominate this sector of the economy by selling foodstuffs, cloth, and inexpensive imported goods, while men or foreign firms controlled the more profitable wholesale and import-export trade. Such opportunities sometimes gave women considerable economic autonomy. By the 1930s, for example, Nupe women in northern Nigeria had gained sufficient wealth as itinerant traders that they were contributing more to the family income than their husbands and frequently lent money to them.</p>

        <h2>Schlieffen war plan</h2>
            <p>The Schlieffen Plan was a name given, after the First World War, to German war plans, the influence of Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen and his thinking on an invasion of France and Belgium which began on 4 August 1914.

        <h2>The Treaty of Versailles</h2>
            <p>The 1919 treaty that officially ended World War I; the immense penalties it placed on Germany are regarded as one of the causes of World War II.</p>
        <h2>The League of Nations</h2>

                <li>Consequences</li>
                It was good to see many people stepping u to care for their communities, but many bad things happened.
                Rumours spread about the disease and people tried to scapegoat groups (that race caused the disease)
                We learned of the importance of things like qurantines and public health, and eventually developed a vaccine.
                Millions died, and people were even more sick of the war.
