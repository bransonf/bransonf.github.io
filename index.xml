      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Branson Fox, a Sociology student at Saint Louis University.
This website covers the scope of the research and projects that I am working on. I am particularly interested in quantitative data analysis and making maps.
Be warned, the website is very much in its early stages. But with due time you can expect to see really interesting data visualizations (especially maps!) and hopefully learn something from my many research endeavors.</description>
