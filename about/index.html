  <h1>About Me</h1>
    
  <p>I'm an undergraduate studying Sociology at Saint Louis University. My plan is to pursue a Ph.D. in Sociology following completion of my Bachelors. I am interested in research of health disparities, violence and urban place. My skills are in spatial and computational methods. I am an avid supporter of open source software and open data.

    You can find my curriculum vitae <a href="https://bransonf.github.io/bransonf_cv.pdf">here.</a>
  <p>
        But when I'm not writing <a href="https://github.com/bransonf">R code</a>, or <a href="https://bransonf.github.io/maps">making maps</a>, I'm probably reading, listening to music or riding my bike.
