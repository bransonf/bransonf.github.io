      I'm always pursuing new ideas, and I have a niche interest in how our behaviors in the past have created the conditions we see today, and what this may mean for the future.
    <p>
        More specifically, I am very interested in the economic and health disparities we have introduced into our now complex society. It is the people who have no choice in their life who remain the most oppressed. No matter how hard they may have tried, economic mobility and good health were deliberately withheld.
        The United States government created the conditions for which we now see demographic disparities in economics and health.

        My most ambitious research project to date is going to be into the relationships between historic policymaking, forced economic oppression, and incredibly disparate rates of asthma. The working name of the project is <i>suffocation</i> implying both economic oppression and being starved of air.
