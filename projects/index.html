    Here is an overview of the projects I am involved in or have future plans for:
    <p>
    <i> I will be quickly learning html, just for the sake of builidng a great website from the ground up.
   </i>
        </p>
       
      <p>
      Obviously, my css will have to catch up quickly too.</p>
