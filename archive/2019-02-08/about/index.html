  <p>I'm an undergraduate studying Sociology at Saint Louis University. My plan is to pursue a Ph.D. in Sociology following completion of my Bachelors. I am interested in research of health disparities, violence and urban place. My skills are in spatial and computational methods. I am an avid supporter of open source software and open data.

        But when I'm not writing <a class=link href="https://github.com/bransonf"><c1>R code</c1></a>, or making <a href="../maps/index.html"><c1>maps</c1></a>, I'm probably reading, <a href="../gallery/index.html"><c1>taking pictures</c1></a>, listening to music, or riding my bike. I also enjoying playing basketball and golfing.
